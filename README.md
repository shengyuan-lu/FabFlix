### Design and Implementation of Fuzzy Search
If the search input entered by the users is a substring of the complete movie title, or if the number of characters mistyped is within the edit distance of the correct movie title, it would be considered a match.
The edit distance is defined as the length of the search input divided by 5, rounded down to an integer.
